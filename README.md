# Movie Genre Classification

## Description
This project aims to classify movie genres based on various features using machine learning techniques. The classification model is trained on a dataset containing movie-related attributes to predict the corresponding genres.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature extraction
- Implementation of machine learning models
- Evaluation of model performance
- Visualization of classification results

## Installation
