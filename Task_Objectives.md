üìå Task Objectives
The objective of this project is to develop a Movie Genre Classification system using machine learning techniques. The key goals include:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for training.

Feature Extraction: Extracting important features such as text embeddings, metadata, or other movie attributes.

Model Training: Training a classification model using machine learning algorithms.

Evaluation: Measuring model performance using relevant metrics.

Deployment (Optional): If applicable, deploying the model for real-world usage.

‚öôÔ∏è Steps to Run the Project
1Ô∏è‚É£ Setup the Environment
Ensure Python is installed (Recommended: Python 3.8+)

Install necessary dependencies using:

sh
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
2Ô∏è‚É£ Prepare the Dataset
Place the dataset inside the data/ folder.

If external data is required, download it from the specified source.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Jupyter Notebook
Open the Jupyter Notebook using:

sh
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook
Load the Movie_Genre_Classification.ipynb file.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Execute the Code Cells
Follow the notebook structure step by step.

Run each cell to perform data preprocessing, training, and evaluation.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Analyze Results
Review classification accuracy and performance metrics.

Generate plots or visualizations if applicable.
